## Customization

The responsive navbar can be easily customized to match your project's requirements. Here are some key files and components that you might want to modify:

- **`src/components/Navbar.js`**: This is the main navbar component. You can add or remove links, adjust the layout, and update the styling in this file.

- **`src/App.js`**: The main application file. You can modify the overall layout or add other components to the app in this file.

- **`src/styles`**: The folder contains CSS files that control the styling of the components. You can modify these files to customize the appearance of the navbar and other elements.

- **Media Queries**: The project uses CSS media queries to make the navbar responsive. You can find these queries in the CSS files and adjust them according to your design requirements.
